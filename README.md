# simplecc

A simple Chinese Convert library (partially) compatible with
[OpenCC](https://github.com/BYVoid/OpenCC/)'s 
[dictionaries](https://github.com/BYVoid/OpenCC/tree/master/data/dictionary).

* Simple
  
  No complex configurations, all need is a text dictionary and input text.

* Fast

  Use hashmap with tree structure for dictionary, faster than original OpenCC.
